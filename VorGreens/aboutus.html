            <p>
                VOrgreens was founded in 2011 with the aim of bringing a new dimension to healthy eatery and approach to
                fast food. Today’s society is becoming increasingly disconnected with their food – we want to show that
                food consumption should be honest, trustworthy and real. As we’ve grown over the past few years, we
                constantly strive to improve and embrace an attitude to be “better than yesterday”.
            </p><br><br>
            <p>
                We currently operate in Singapore, Philippines, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Spain, Korea, Vietnam and
                Malaysia. We aim to become the world’s leading nutrition, health and wellness company serving the best
                tasting, most nutritious food. As we expand our footprint in the region, we remain true to our core
                values and commitment to the ideology of “Eat Wide Awake” through all aspects.
            </p><br><br>
            <p>
                As we set up the salad bar every morning, we are driven by the communities that we work with and the
                lives that we are able to impact. We are just at the beginning of an amazing journey and dream about a
                world where farmers are respected and customers can start trusting their food again. We are still a
                small company but with big dreams and hope that we can be one of the catalysts in this change.
